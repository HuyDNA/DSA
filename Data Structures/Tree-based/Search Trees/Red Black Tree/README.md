# Self-balancing Tree - Red Black Tree
## Concept
Red Black Tree (RBTree) is a self-balancing tree data structure invented by Rudolf Bayer in 1972.  
Each node in an RBTree has an additional _Color_ bit which is either ![red][red]`Red` or ![black][black]`Black`, hence the name. To be more precise, RBTree is a _Binary Search Tree_ with the following properties:
* Each node is either ![red][red]`Red` or ![black][black]`Black` 

```cpp
#include <iostream>

```

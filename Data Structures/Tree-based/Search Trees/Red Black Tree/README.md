# Self-balancing Tree - Red Black Tree
![Red Black Tree](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Red-black_tree_example.svg)

This is based on what I have learned from the book [Introduction to Algorithm](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition).
## What is Red Black Tree? 
**Red Black Tree** is a self-balancing tree data structure invented by Rudolf Bayer in 1972.

Each node in an **Red Black Tree** has an additional ***Color*** bit which is either ![][red]`Red` or ![][black]`Black`, hence the name. To be more precise, **Red Black Tree** is a ***Binary Search Tree*** with the following properties:
1. All nodes with relevant keys are internal nodes and all leaf nodes are sentinels that are used in place of the usual **nullptr** value.
2. Each node is either ![][red]`Red` or ![][black]`Black`. 
3. The root node is ![][black]`Black`.
4. All leaf nodes are ![][black]`Black`.
5. Both children of a ![][red]`Red` node are ![][black]`Black`.
6. Every path from the root to any leaves contains the same number of ![][black]`Black` nodes.

## Why would I care about this red and black thing?
**Red Black Tree** has the desired property of a balanced search tree: Its height is always $O(lgn)$ with $n$ is the number of keys. We have the following result:
> **Theorem.** Given $n$ is the number of internal nodes, a **Red Black Tree**'s height is $O(lgn)$.

**Proof.**
```cpp
#include <iostream>

```
